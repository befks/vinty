0. Download
-----------
::

    $ git clone http://code.google.com/p/vinty/


1. Included applications
   ---------------------

   - vinty       -- commandline tool to create/renew/revoke certificates.
                    See vinty(8) for usage information.

   - vintypasswd -- set or remove passphrases from RSA keys generated with
                    vinty. See vintyapasswd(1) for usage information.

2. Web Application
   ---------------

   A web application to manage your certificates is included and has all
   the functionality of the vinty commandline utility.

   Additionally, certificate/key pairs, together with the CA's certificate
   can be downloaded as a zipfile from the web application.

   Another feature of the web application is the ability to publish the
   CRL from the application, by calling an external script.

3. Configuration
   -------------

   The main configuration file is /etc/vinty/vinty.cfg. The default
   configuration should be edited before either the commandline tool
   or the web application are used.

4. Bugs
   ----

   The vinty commandline application and the webfrontend cannot
   easily work together. See vinty(8) for details.

5. Make debian package
   -------------------
   cd $DIR/vinty
   dch (command to edit the changelog if needed)
   dpkg-buildpackage
